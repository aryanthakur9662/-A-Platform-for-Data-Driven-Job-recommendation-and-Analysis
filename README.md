# -A-Platform-for-Data-Driven-Job-recommendation-and-Analysis
A web application that integrates job search and filtering, similar jobs recommendation and data analytics and visualization under the same platform.

1. Introduction

The job market is ever-changing, requiring both employers and job seekers to navigate
through a complex array of options. The need for a dynamic, data-driven approach has
never been greater. To meet this demand, we have developed a recommendation and
analysis platform specifically tailored for data work.

1.1 Purpose of the project

The primary purpose of this project is to create a centralized, data-driven platform to
address the challenges faced by employers and job seekers in today's job market.
Utilizing machine learning algorithms and real-time data analysis, the platform aims to
provide:
Customized job recommendations based on individual skills, experiences, and
preferences.
An analytics dashboard that offers recruiters valuable insights into labor market trends,
including in-demand skills, industry-specific salaries, and emerging job categories.

1.2 Target Beneficiary

The target beneficiaries of this platform are,
Job Seekers: Who will benefit from personalized job recommendations that align with
their career goals, skills, and experience.
Recruiters, HR Departments, and Recruiting Firms: Who will gain valuable market
insights to guide their recruitment strategies.

1.3 Project Scope

The scope of this platform encompasses
Data Gathering: Real-time data collection from various job portals and company websites
using API keys.
Data Analysis: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the
collected data.
User Experience: Providing a user-friendly interface for both job seekers and recruiters to
interact with the platform.
Reporting: Offering an analytics dashboard to present summarized and actionable labor
market trends.

3. Problem statement
   
In the contemporary job market, job seekers face a complex landscape of challenges that
extend beyond the traditional considerations of location and salary. These encompass a
broader set of factors, including relocation feasibility, associated costs, skill-based career
alignment, alternative job opportunities, comprehensive compensation evaluations,
cultural fit assessments, and staying abreast of evolving industry trends. Unfortunately,
existing job search platforms often fall short of addressing these multifaceted challenges
comprehensively.
Moreover, they cannot translate the vast amount of available data into meaningful
visualizations that can empower job seekers with actionable insights. The absence of such
visualizations hinders job seekers from making informed career choices, leaving them
with incomplete information and limited perspectives. As a result, there is a growing need
for a more holistic solution that not only analyzes these complex factors but also presents
them in intuitive and informative visual formats, revolutionizing the job-seeking
experience and equipping job seekers with a deeper understanding of their career options.

4. Existing system issue

Based on the literature review done for this project the major issues in the existing
projects are:-

● Limited Search Filters: Users might face difficulty in refining job searches due
to a lack of diverse or specific search filters.

● Incomplete Job Profiles: Some job listings might lack detailed information,
making it harder for users to make informed decisions.

● Inaccurate Recommendations: The system might occasionally suggest jobs that
are not aligned with a user's skills or interests.

5.2 Data/Data Structure

API Integration and Data Retrieval

● Utilizes API keys for data collection from job portals and company
websites
● Uses ChromeDriverManager and WebDriver for web scraping where
APIs are not available

Data Storage

● All collected data is stored in a PostgreSQL database

● Structured in tables to hold job listings, user profiles, and analytics data

5.4 Project Features

Frontend Development

● Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

● User-friendly interface for both job seekers and recruiters

Backend Development

● Built using and Flask

● Secure and scalable, capable of handling high volumes of data

6.3 Database Interface

Utilizes PostgreSQL for data services:

Job Listings Table: Includes fields such as Job ID, Company, Role, Description,
Skills Required, and Location.

User Profiles Table: Includes fields such as User ID, Name, Skills, Experience,
and Preferences.

Analytics Table: Holds data related to market trends, such as most demanded
skills, emerging sectors, and average salaries.

Database connections are managed via PostgreSQL, Docker and PGAdmin as a
SQL client for efficient querying and data manipulation.
